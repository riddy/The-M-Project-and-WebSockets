Usage of the Example:

if express and socket.io isn’t installed on your machine, you have to install it. We recommend you to use npm.

install express and socket.io globally:	
npm install -g express
npm install -g socket.io

or locally:
	
npm install express
npm install socket.io

start the socket server:
	
node path/to/the/file/socket-server.js

if this isn’t working open the file and comment the second line:
	
//try this one if there are problems to require socket-io or express
//require.paths.push('/usr/local/lib/node_modules');

now start the app:

cd /path/to/the/app/MySocketTest/
espresso server

this prints something like this:
	LOG: Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/MySocketTest

and point your browser to the given URL and have fun.

You can run the built version too: /path/to/the/app/MySocketTest/build/1326446955938/index.html
if the socket-server runs on "localhost"


* you find M.SocketRequest in:
frameworks/The-M-Project/modules/core/foundation/socket-request.js


* you find M.ConnectionCheckRequest in
frameworks/The-M-Project/modules/core/foundation/connectioncheck-request.js
This is a modification of the M.Request, which checks the network-status before an ajax-request. 

You can hand oer a method to execute if the app is offline 
and cache the ajax request until you are back online
